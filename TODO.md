GPT - Terminal Objective:
    GPT-Terminal, a large language model with prompt engineering to perform tasks over the terminal from simple bash commands to code generation to fully-functional applications.  
    
    Built upon the task management, auto-gpt frame work, GPT-Terminal can use the task management systems to construct complex projects by completing a series of tasks. 
    
    Multi-agent work flows for AI collaborations, using prompt engineering; a collection of models are given seperate diverse system prompts on specialization-specific tasks to work together to build more complex projects.
